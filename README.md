## Installation and Setup

### docker is optional, feel free to skip it if you're not comfortable

1. Setup PostgreSQL Database and OPTIONALLY wrap in Docker container
    * Install postgres if you do not have it already https://www.postgresql.org/download/
        * Make a note of your username and password
    * note: you can skip the below dockerize step if you want to run postgres locally
    * Docker Installation - Follow instuctions for your specific platform:
        * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
        * Confirm installation of Docker: `$ docker -v`
        * [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
        * Confirm installation of Docker Compose: `$ docker-compose --version`
2. Download or [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) repository.
3. Run `nvm use` to ensure you are using the proper node version
4. Install required dependencies:
  -  run `npm ci` from within `/server` directory and from the `/client` directory.
  - run `npm run prepare` from within `/server` directory and from the `/client` directory.
5. Copy the below environmental variables into a `.env` file that you create in `/server` directory
```
PORT=3001
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=8080
DATABASE_USER=postgres
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_password
DATABASE_DB=test_db
BCRYPT_WORK_FACTOR=10   
# e2e only used when running e2e tests
E2E_DATABASE_DB=e2e_db
# sockets gateway cors
SOCKET_CORS_ORIGIN="http://localhost:3000"
```
6. In that `.env` file we'll now customize some of those values
    * If you are using the non-dockerized version of postgres, change the `DATABASE_PORT` value to `5432`
    * check if postgres is installed: `postgres --version`
    * check if postgres service is running: `brew services list | grep postgres` (leave out the piping to see all brew services)
    * commands for service management:
        * start service: `brew services start postgresql`
        * stop service: `brew services stop postgresql`
        * restart service: `brew services restart postgresql`
    * once postgres is running, try `psql`, it will say `Password for user USERNAME`, try some usual passwords
        * if you get in:
            * put that username and password in the env vars
            * run `\list` to list DBs and put one of them in the DATABASE_DB value
        * if you don't get in:
            * we're going to try something like https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15008204/how-to-check-postgres-user-and-password/15008311
            * login to postgres with superuse: `sudo su -`
            * password should be your computer's login password
            * from there, use some sort of combination of the following commands to find or create a user and set the .env var values
```
# list databases:
$ \list
# list users:
$ \du
# create postgres user with postgres password:
$ create user postgres with encrypted password 'postgres';
# add superuser role to postgres user:
$ alter user postgres with superuser;
# add create role role to postgres user:
$ alter user postgres with createrole;
# add create DB role to postgres user:
$ alter user postgres with createdb;
# add replication role to postgres user:
$ alter user postgres with replication;
# add bypass RLS role to postgres user:
$ alter user postgres with bypassrls;
# check password is set and roles are assigned:
$ select * from pg_shadow;
```

    * if you aren't using homebrew, here are some helpful resources and commands
```
# https://www.robinwieruch.de/postgres-sql-macos-setup/

# create postgres database (should only need doing once?)
$ initdb /usr/local/var/postgres
# start server (optionally add/remove `-l logfile` to move log from terminal to a file)
$ pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l logfile start
# stop server
$ pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres stop
```

## Startup

1. Run `nvm use` to ensure you are using the proper node version
2. If using postgres-dockerized workflow, from `/server` directory, run `npm run start:dev:db`
    * Terminal should show a successful start of the docker container, but this can be confirmed by running `docker ps` in terminal to view all running containers. One should match the name of `container_name` from `docker-compose.yml` file
3. To start Nest backend in watch mode: From `/server` directory, run `npm run start:dev`
4. in another terminal, still inside `/server`: `npm run seed:drop` to create some dev data
5. To start up React frontend: From `/client` directory, run `npm start`. A browser page should start up automatically. If not, visit `localhost:3000`.

## Test
Most tests are still in development.
### Backend
From the `/server` directory.
```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
### Frontend
From the `/client` directory.
```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test
```

## Postgres & Docker
### Running Postgres Test Database from the Docker CLI
1. Open and run the Docker desktop app
2. Start database: `$ npm run start:dev:db `
3. Start server: `$ npm run start:dev`
4. From a new terminal window:
```
# get a bash shell in the "postgres" docker container:
$ docker exec -it postgres /bin/bash

# login to your database:
$ su - postgres

# enter the PostgreSQL environment:
$ psql

# connect to the test_db database:
$ \c test_db

# From here you should be able to see all of the tables in the test_db with:
$ \dt

#You can now run SQL commands and queries here
```

### Access psql inside a docker container in a single line: 
`$ docker exec -it <container-id> psql -U <username> -d <database-name>`

source: [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53974488/how-to-delete-and-recreate-a-postgres-database-using-a-single-docker-command)

### Useful Postgres Commands
Log into your local postgres server:
```
# format is: su - <postgres role name>
# so something like...
$ su - postgres
```

Enter into psql command prompt within the postgresql server
`$ psql`

List Roles
`$ \du`

Connect to a specific database 
`$ \c <db_name>`

List all tables within a database after connecting to it
`$ \dt`
