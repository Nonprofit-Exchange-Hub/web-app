# Server Development

## Unit Testing

Not making the most use of unit testing at the moment due to the amount of mocking it requires - which may be constantly changing while we build the MVP

## e2e (Integration Testing)

We are invensting more time in e2e testing on the server side.

The general strategy is to test the server api endpoints as the front end would use it, so ideally we would have e2e tests for each endpoint. See more details: [e2e testing](test/E2ETESTING.md)
